# Riows

Riows is a webserver built for easy deployment and installation that will handle static files and dynamic content.

## Little history

Riows is a re-write from scratch of my old webserver `rio` (https://github.com/felipecruz/rio) which is linux compatible, only, and
has many design flaws (although it does more than handle static files). When I started `rio` I wasn't prepared for creating such a
complex project but I did managed to create a good websocket parser library (https://github.com/felipecruz/cws) and a utf8 sequence
validator (https://github.com/felipecruz/utf8v) while developing it.

## Compatibility

Currently, it only works on **64 bits** systems and it's testes against: Linux, OSX and FreeBSD.

## Features

So far, Riows only handle static content and it'll serve the files on the working directory.

## Installing

It depends on `openssl`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/felipecruz/riows.git && cd riows
git submodule init
git submodule update
make
sudo make install
```

## Running

```sh
sudo riows
```

## Testing

Riows has unit tests but still does not have functional tests.

### Running All Unit Tests

```sh
make ta
```

### Running specific module Unit Tests

```sh
make test module_name
```

`module_name` can be `rioev` or `rstatic`
